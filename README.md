# AIdraw
AI drawer, mostly written by AI itself.
This is very easy drawer which can draw images by specifying text. It saves output to file or stdout.
This is mostly test project. I tried to instruct AI to write this. Not sure about license. Hope that GPL is OK when it was generated by AI and updated by me :]

## Examples

This will create directory 'Nice red box' and generates three pictures within:
```
aidraw.py --count=3 "Nice red box"
```

![1](examples/Nice%20red%20box/aidraw-1.jpg?raw=true)
![2](examples/Nice%20red%20box/aidraw-2.jpg?raw=true)
![3](examples/Nice%20red%20box/aidraw-3.jpg?raw=true)

This will create one file with better resolution:
```
 aidraw.py --size 1024x1024 --count=1 "Green car with black roof"
```
![1](examples/Green%20car%20with%20black%20roof/aidraw-1.jpg?raw=true)
