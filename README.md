# AIdraw
AI drawer, mostly written by AI itself.
This is very easy drawer which can draw images by specifying text. It saves output to file or stdout.
This is mostly test project. I tried to instruct AI to write this. Not sure about license. Hope that GPL is OK when it was generated by AI and updated by me :]

## API key
